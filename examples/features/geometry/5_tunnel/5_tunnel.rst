Tunnel Geometry
===============

1_long_straight.gmad
--------------------

A drift section, with a thin collimator that's offset so the beam definitely hits it,
followed by another long drift section. The tunnel is cylindrical, and of a typical size
of an acceleartor and offset a little bit. The floor and soil are also built. This uses
the newer modular physics lists.
