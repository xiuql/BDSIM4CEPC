1_rotation.gmad - beam pipe, followed by tilted quadrupole. Achieved by using transform3d.
		  This should *only* rotate about the beam axis.

2_rotation_with_bends.gmaad - primitive medical gantry style beamline. Few strong sector
                              bends separated by drifts. Transform3d makes the line bend
                              vertically.
