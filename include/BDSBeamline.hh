/**
 * @brief A vector of BDSBeamlineElement instances - a beamline.
 * 
 * This will calculate and construct a beamline as BDSAcceleratorComponents
 * are added in sequence - ie it calculates their placement positions and 
 * rotations with respect to the start of the beamline as well as their s
 * position in curvilinear coordinates.
 * 
 * Note, this is not a singleton as geometry hierarchy can be introduced
 * by placing beamline components inside parent volumes and therefore creating
 * a new beamline of parents. It can also be used to create multiple beam lines.
