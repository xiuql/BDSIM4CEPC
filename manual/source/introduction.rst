Purpose of BDSIM
----------------

Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM) is a C++ program that utilises the Geant4
toolkit to simulate both the transport of particles in an accelerator and
their interaction with the accelerator material. BDSIM is capable of
simulating a wide variety of accelerator components and magnets with Geant4
geometry dynamically built based on a text input file.
